----- COMMAND LINE OPTIONS -----


-Devopaint_home=<path>
	Sets the evopaint home directory.
	This is where EvoPaint expects the collections/ folder and stores temporary
	files (eg. for video encoding).
	
	Use like this (from inside the base directory):
	java -cp "build:lib/*" -Devopaint_home="/tmp" evopaint.EvoPaint
	Or with relative path:
	java -cp "build:lib/*" -Devopaint_home="../../" evopaint.EvoPaint

----- KNOWN BUGS -----


Saving/Loading in Agent Simulation Mode takes too long / does not work
Saving an evolution is currently only feasible for smaller evolutions because of the sheer amount of data that is exported to a file before compressed. Yes, this sucks. I will come up with a streaming solution some day. Until then try and reduce the amount of painted pixels in evolutions. Cellular automatons are not affected and can be saved up to reasonable sizes without problems.
